# Ink
### Journal, reimagined.

## Design Philosophy

Across technology, the products people trust most aren’t winning by doing more — they’re winning by doing **one thing intentionally well**.

**WHOOP** chose to remove the screen entirely. No notifications, no apps — just recovery, strain, and sleep interpreted clearly. That restraint is exactly why people prefer it.

Many creators still choose **dedicated or physical cameras** over phone cameras, not for convenience, but for focus, control, and intentional use.

In both cases, the value comes from what the product *doesn’t* try to be.

We believe journaling works best the same way.

At the same time, people continue to choose simpler tools — paper planners, physical notebooks, and e-ink readers — not out of nostalgia, but because they reduce noise and help sustain focus.

**The pattern is consistent:**
> Do fewer things, but do the right one extremely well.

### Where journaling apps went wrong
Most journaling apps try to do everything:
prompts, streaks, gamification, chatbots, feeds, metrics.

Instead of helping reflection, they can turn journaling into performance.

### Ink’s philosophy
Ink takes the opposite approach.

- **No prompts**
- **No chat**
- **No gamification**
- **Just a blank page — honest, private, uninterrupted**
- With digital benefits: **portability, permanence, calendar organization, and gentle weekly insights**

Writing comes first. Insight comes later.

> “We simplified the writing experience — not because we could do less, but because doing more would get in the way.”

### Future vision (hardware)
This philosophy extends beyond software: Ink is designed to evolve into a **thin, premium e-ink journal device** — a calm tool you pick up to write, not to scroll. A modern “physical journal” that preserves the ritual of writing while keeping the benefits of digital.
